# GreenVestor

Greenvestor is a web-based platform that operates on the web3 DEFI (Decentralized Finance) technology. It aims to connect individuals who want to borrow capital for sustainable projects with those who are interested in investing in these projects.

The platform allows users to explore a variety of sustainable projects and choose to invest in them or provide loans. These projects could involve areas like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, or green technology. Users can browse through project listings, review project details, and assess their potential impact and financial viability.

For individuals looking to invest, the platform offers investment options with different minimum amounts and expected returns. Users can select projects that align with their interests and financial goals. On the other hand, individuals with sustainable projects can create funding campaigns, providing information about their projects and setting funding targets.

The platform ensures transparency and security by leveraging smart contracts on the Hedera network, a blockchain-based platform. Users can track the performance of their investments or funded projects, receiving regular updates and access to performance metrics. They can also participate in project discussions and collaborate with project creators.

Overall, the project aims to facilitate the funding and investment process for sustainable projects while promoting transparency, trust, and community involvement through web3 DEFI technology.
